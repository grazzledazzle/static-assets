# static-assets
This is a repo of static assets to serve images etc. from fixed URLs.

Primary motivation is make use of Obsidian Bases core plugin. It allows images on card views, but large image files, PDFs, etc. quickly increase overall vault size, which is especially a problem with a vault syncing with mobile.
